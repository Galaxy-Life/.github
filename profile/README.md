# Galaxy Life
Welcome to the official Galaxy Life GitHub organization!
Here we host all our projects and even though most of them are private, there are a few which are open-source!

We will always look at all incoming issues and pull requests on any of our public repositories, so feel free to make some!
Scroll down for a list of our public repositories!

## [Galaxy Life Discord Bot](https://github.com/Galaxy-Life/DiscordBot)
We have our own Discord Bot that is being used in 250+ Discord servers!
This bot uses the latest Discord features, such as buttons, modals and other interactive components.

We would love for the community to help work on the bot, this will in turn gives us more time to work on the actual game!

## [GL.NET](https://github.com/Galaxy-Life/GL.NET)
GL.NET is the underlying C# wrapper for our Galaxy Life and Phoenix Network's (the parent company) API.
This API can be used with and without access tokens, though your endpoints will be very limited. (access tokens are currently for developers only)

This is something that will be maintained by us and can be used in for example the bot, or our landing page / moderation panel.
Any issues or feature requests can still be left behind here!

## [ElectronLauncher](https://github.com/Galaxy-Life/ElectronLauncher)
While this repository is archived, we have used it in the past to distribute the Galaxy Life game for an easier use.
This repository will no longer be interacted with or used, but it should still build and run.

The launcher we currently use, is heavily based on this one. So you can find out some things about how the current launcher works as well.
